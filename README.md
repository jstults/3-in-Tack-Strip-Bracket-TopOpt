3-in-Tack-Strip-Bracket-TopOpt
==============================

Topology optimization of a bracket for a 3-in tack strip.

The ToPy problem definition is in 'brkt.tpd'.  Find ToPy here: 
  https://code.google.com/p/topy/

Run the optimization like this: 
  python optimise.py brkt.tpd

Convert the png output to a dxf in Inkscape.  This result is in 'brkt.dxf'.

Use OpenSCAD to extrude the dxf and cut some useful holes for mounting things on the bracket.  This is done in 'brkt.scad'.

This design is based on this thing:
